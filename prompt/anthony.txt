Based on the provided context information, which includes descriptions and examples of vulnerabilities in C code, 
use this data to examine the code below. Your goal is to identify any present vulnerabilities, relying solely on the retrieved context. 
For each detected vulnerability, please name the vulnerability by using the CWE number and provide an explanatory comment on the nature of 
the vulnerability and its location in the code.

If you identify vulnerabilities, structure your response in the following manner:
{{
"comment": [
    ["vulnerable_text_line", "CWE_number", "comment on the vulnerability"],
    ["vulnerable_text_line", "CWE_number", "comment on the vulnerability"],
    ...
]
}}

If no vulnerabilities are detected, please state explicitly:
{{
"comment": "No vulnerabilities detected."
}}

Please carefully examine the code below while considering the contextual information retrieved. This is crucial for the precise identification of vulnerabilities.\\n
